"git reflog" can check all the events, like commits, undo commits, etc.
    inside reflog, there are events number e.g. HEAD@{5}
    if you want to go back to the state of HEAD@{5}, use git reset <option> HEAD@{5}
    if HEAD@{4} is a commit. 
        git reset --soft HEAD@{5}   ->  just undo the commit
        git reset        HEAD@{5}   ->  undo both commit and add
        git reset --hard HEAD@{5}   ->  undo commit and add, finally remove the changes

"git log" can check the commits history, cannot check undo commits.
     with commits number inside the log, say abedef123gh
     if you want to go back to abcdef123gh
         git reset --soft abcedf123gh  -> just undo the commit
         git reset        abcedf123gh  -> undo commit and add
         git reset --hard abcedf123gh  -> undo commit and add, finally remove the changes

"git reset <file_name>" can unstage the added file.
